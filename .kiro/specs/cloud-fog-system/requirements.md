# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cloud-Based Fog of War System enhances the existing Cartographer application with a sophisticated, visually stunning cloud rendering system that creates realistic fog effects over unexplored map areas. This system builds upon the current fog overlay functionality by implementing volumetric cloud rendering, realistic cloud physics, and smooth dissipation animations that create an immersive exploration experience. The clouds should appear as realistic 3D-like formations that naturally obscure the map beneath while providing satisfying visual feedback when areas are explored and revealed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see realistic, volumetric clouds covering unexplored areas, so that the fog of war feels natural and immersive like real weather.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL render volumetric-looking clouds with realistic density variations and natural edges
2. WHEN viewing clouds at different zoom levels THEN the system SHALL maintain visual quality and appropriate detail scaling
3. WHEN clouds are rendered THEN the system SHALL use multiple opacity layers to create depth and volume effects
4. WHEN displaying clouds THEN the system SHALL implement soft, organic edges that blend naturally with the map surface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clouds to move and animate naturally, so that the fog feels alive and dynamic rather than static.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clouds are displayed THEN the system SHALL animate cloud movement with subtle drift patterns
2. WHEN cloud animations run THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance on target devices
3. WHEN clouds move THEN the system SHALL use realistic wind-like patterns that vary across different map regions
4. WHEN animating clouds THEN the system SHALL implement subtle morphing effects to simulate natural cloud evolution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an explorer, I want clouds to dissipate beautifully when I visit new areas, so that revealing the map feels rewarding and satisfying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter an unexplored area THEN the system SHALL trigger a smooth cloud dissipation animation
2. WHEN clouds dissipate THEN the system SHALL use realistic clearing patterns that spread outward from my location
3. WHEN fog clears THEN the system SHALL animate the transition over 2-3 seconds with natural fading effects
4. WHEN dissipation occurs THEN the system SHALL reveal the underlying map progressively with smooth opacity transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cloud system to perform efficiently on mobile devices, so that the visual effects don't impact app responsiveness or battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering clouds THEN the system SHALL optimize performance using efficient texture atlases and shader techniques
2. WHEN the device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce cloud complexity while maintaining visual appeal
3. WHEN running cloud animations THEN the system SHALL use GPU acceleration and minimize CPU overhead
4. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement texture streaming and cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want cloud coverage to adapt intelligently to different geographic regions, so that the fog feels contextually appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying different map regions THEN the system SHALL vary cloud density based on geographic context
2. WHEN over water bodies THEN the system SHALL render appropriate marine fog effects with different visual characteristics
3. WHEN in mountainous regions THEN the system SHALL adapt cloud height and density to match terrain elevation
4. WHEN in urban areas THEN the system SHALL adjust cloud patterns to complement city layouts and street visibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cloud system to integrate seamlessly with the existing exploration mechanics, so that the enhanced visuals don't disrupt the core gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cloud system activates THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing exploration data and SQLite storage
2. WHEN areas are already explored THEN the system SHALL respect existing cleared regions without re-fogging
3. WHEN location updates occur THEN the system SHALL integrate with current GPS tracking without affecting location accuracy
4. WHEN switching between cloud and traditional fog modes THEN the system SHALL preserve exploration state and user progress

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want customizable cloud settings, so that I can adjust the visual experience to my preferences and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust cloud density, animation speed, and visual quality
2. WHEN on lower-end devices THEN the system SHALL offer performance modes that reduce visual complexity
3. WHEN customizing appearance THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose between different cloud styles and color schemes
4. WHEN saving preferences THEN the system SHALL persist cloud settings using AsyncStorage for future app sessions
