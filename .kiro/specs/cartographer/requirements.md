# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Cartographer is a React Native mobile application built with Expo that gamifies real-world exploration through a fog-of-war map interface. The app initially covers the entire world map with a mysterious fog overlay, which dynamically reveals areas based on users' GPS-tracked visits. Using Mapbox for stunning visuals and animated cloud effects, the app provides an engaging, personalized travel footprint visualization experience similar to Google Maps or Apple Maps in terms of user interface familiarity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see a world map covered in animated fog/clouds, so that I can experience the mystery and anticipation of exploration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a world map using Mapbox with animated cloud/fog overlay covering all areas
2. WHEN viewing the map THEN the system SHALL render smooth, realistic cloud animations that move naturally across the map surface
3. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL provide a familiar interface similar to Google Maps or Apple Maps for intuitive navigation
4. WHEN users interact with the map THEN the system SHALL support standard gestures like pinch-to-zoom, pan, and rotate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an explorer, I want the fog to automatically clear from areas I've physically visited, so that I can see my real-world travel footprint visualized on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects my GPS location THEN the system SHALL record my visit to that geographic area
2. WHEN I visit a new location THEN the system SHALL animate the fog/clouds dissipating from that area to reveal the underlying map
3. WHEN fog clears from an area THEN the system SHALL permanently keep that area visible for future app sessions
4. WHEN I revisit a previously explored area THEN the system SHALL maintain the cleared state without re-fogging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want control over location tracking, so that I can manage my privacy while using the exploration features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first launch the app THEN the system SHALL request location permissions with clear explanation of usage
2. WHEN location permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL provide alternative manual exploration options
3. WHEN location permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL track GPS coordinates only for fog-clearing purposes
4. IF location services are disabled THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the limitation and inform the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices, so that I can use it regardless of my mobile platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed through Expo THEN the system SHALL function identically on both iOS and Android platforms
2. WHEN running on different devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface to various screen sizes and resolutions
3. WHEN using platform-specific features THEN the system SHALL handle iOS and Android location services appropriately
4. WHEN updating the app THEN the system SHALL support over-the-air updates through Expo's deployment system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an explorer, I want to see my exploration progress and statistics, so that I can track my discovery achievements and feel motivated to explore more.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access my profile THEN the system SHALL display total areas explored as a percentage or metric
2. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL query SQLite database to show countries, cities, or regions I've visited
3. WHEN I make significant exploration progress THEN the system SHALL update achievement records in database and provide notifications or badges
4. WHEN comparing my progress THEN the system SHALL analyze stored exploration data to offer insights about my exploration patterns over time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform smoothly with beautiful visuals, so that the exploration experience feels engaging and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the map THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance during animations
2. WHEN loading map tiles THEN the system SHALL cache data efficiently to minimize loading times
3. WHEN animating fog dissipation THEN the system SHALL create visually appealing transitions that feel satisfying
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL continue location tracking while respecting battery optimization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my exploration data to persist across app sessions, so that my progress is never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I close and reopen the app THEN the system SHALL restore all previously explored areas from SQLite database
2. WHEN the app crashes or is force-closed THEN the system SHALL recover exploration data without loss using database transactions
3. WHEN I get a new device THEN the system SHALL provide options to backup and restore my SQLite exploration database
4. WHEN storing exploration data THEN the system SHALL use SQLite with spatial indexing for efficient geographic queries and storage management
