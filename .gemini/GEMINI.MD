Always reference the following files and modify them as necessary to ensure they remain accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with project evolution:

1. For Design: .kiro/specs/cartographer-app/design.md

2. For Requirements: .kiro/specs/cartographer-app/requirements.md

3. For Implementation: .kiro/specs/cartographer-app/tasks.md

Your primary objective is to systematically reference, prioritize, and complete each task detailed in tasks.md, ensuring full implementation, validation against real-world scenarios, and thorough documentation of progress.

For every task, cross-reference its corresponding elements in design.md and requirements.md to confirm consistency, resolve any conflicts, and apply updates to these files if needed (e.g., due to new insights, technological changes, or user feedback).

Maintain a cohesive flow across all documents: update specifications in a backward-compatible manner, incorporate detailed justifications for modifications, and ensure tasks are marked as complete only upon successful verification. Communicate any assumptions, dependencies, or blockers encountered during the process. Focus on iterative improvement, code quality, and end-user usability in all actions.
