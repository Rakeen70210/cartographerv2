# Test Failure Analysis and Remediation Plan

This document outlines the errors found in the test run and provides a detailed plan to fix them. The fixes are intended to be implemented by an LLM.

## Test Failures by File

### 1. `src/services/cloudSystem/animation/__tests__/AnimationController.test.ts`

*   **Errors:** Multiple assertion failures where expected values do not match received values.
*   **Cause:** The initial state of the `AnimationController` is not what the tests expect.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Open `src/services/cloudSystem/animation/AnimationController.ts`.
    2.  Check the constructor and default values for `frameRate`, `cloudDrift`, and `morphing`. They are likely not being initialized to the values expected in the tests. Adjust the initial values in the controller to match the test expectations.

### 2. `src/__tests__/e2e/performanceTests.test.ts`

*   **Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reset')`
*   **Cause:** `performanceMonitorService` is `undefined`.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Open `src/__tests__/e2e/performanceTests.test.ts`.
    2.  In a `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` block, ensure that `performanceMonitorService` is properly initialized or mocked.
    ```typescript
    import { performanceMonitorService } from '../../services/performanceMonitorService';

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Example of mocking
      jest.spyOn(performanceMonitorService, 'reset').mockImplementation(() => {});
    });
    ```

### 3. `src/__tests__/e2e/edgeCaseIntegration.test.ts` & `src/__tests__/e2e/coreUserFlows.test.ts`

*   **Error:** `TypeError: _explorationService.explorationService.processLocationUpdate is not a function` and many other similar errors for other services.
*   **Cause:** The services are not being mocked correctly. The tests are attempting to call methods on nested `explorationService` objects, which indicates an issue with how the module is imported or mocked.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Review the imports for all services in these E2E tests.
    2.  The error `_explorationService.explorationService` suggests a namespace import is being used where a default or named import is expected.
    3.  Correct the mocking to target the actual function. For example, if you have `import * as explorationService from '...'`, you should mock `jest.spyOn(explorationService, 'processLocationUpdate')`. If you have `import { explorationService } from '...'`, you should mock methods directly on the imported object.
    4.  The same fix applies to `achievementsService`, `offlineService`, `errorRecoveryService`, etc.

### 4. `src/services/cloudSystem/performance/__tests__/DeviceCapabilityDetector.test.ts`

*   **Error:** `expect(received).toMatch(expected)` Matcher error: received value must be a string. Received has type: number
*   **Cause:** The `capabilities?.webglVersion` is a number, but the test is using `toMatch` which is for strings/regex.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Open `src/services/cloudSystem/performance/__tests__/DeviceCapabilityDetector.test.ts`.
    2.  Change the assertion to check if the number is 1 or 2. For example, use `expect([1, 2]).toContain(capabilities?.webglVersion)`.

### 5. `src/__tests__/e2e/errorHandlingTests.test.ts`

*   **Error:** Multiple errors, mostly `TypeError: ... is not a function` and `Property ... does not exist in the provided object`.
*   **Cause:** Services are not mocked correctly, similar to the other e2e tests.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Review the imports for all services in this E2E test.
    2.  Correct the mocking to target the actual function for services like `explorationService`, `errorRecoveryService`, `locationService`.

### 6. `src/services/cloudSystem/geography/__tests__/TerrainAwareCloudGenerator.test.ts`

*   **Error:** `expect(received).not.toEqual(expected)`. The updated density is the same as the original.
*   **Cause:** The `updateCloudDensity` function is not actually changing the density values. The terrain data or the modifiers are not being applied correctly.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Open `src/services/cloudSystem/geography/TerrainAwareCloudGenerator.ts`.
    2.  Review the logic in `updateCloudDensity` to ensure the terrain data is correctly modifying the cloud density.

### 7. `src/__tests__/performance/performanceOptimization.test.ts`

*   **Error:** Multiple errors including `TypeError: this.performanceMonitorService.getCurrentMetrics is not a function`, `Property 'getCurrentMetrics' does not exist`, `TypeError: memoryManagementService.initialize is not a function`.
*   **Cause:** Services (`performanceMonitorService`, `memoryManagementService`) are not initialized or mocked correctly. Methods are missing or not spied on correctly.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Open `src/__tests__/performance/performanceOptimization.test.ts`.
    2.  In a `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` block, ensure that `performanceMonitorService` and `memoryManagementService` are properly initialized or mocked, including all methods called in the tests.
