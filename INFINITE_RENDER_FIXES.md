# React Infinite Re-render Issue Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the "maximum update depth exceeded" error on Android by implementing comprehensive solutions to prevent infinite re-render loops in React components.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing cleanup in useEffect hooks** - Components continued updating after unmount
2. **Incorrect dependency arrays** - Caused unnecessary re-renders when objects changed
3. **Excessive location updates** - Location service triggered too many state updates
4. **Cascading re-renders** - One component update triggered multiple others
5. **Missing debouncing** - Rapid successive calls caused render loops

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. App.tsx
- Added `isMounted` check to prevent state updates after component unmount
- Added proper cleanup function to useEffect
- Fixed initialization to be one-time only

### 2. MapContainer.tsx
- Added `isMounted` pattern to all async operations
- Fixed useEffect dependency arrays to use specific properties instead of entire objects
- Added debouncing to camera updates (100ms delay)
- Added memoization with `useCallback` for event handlers
- Improved location similarity checks to prevent excessive updates
- Added cleanup functions to all useEffect hooks

### 3. MapScreen.tsx
- Added `isMounted` check to fog-location integration initialization
- Added proper cleanup for integration service
- Fixed useEffect to have empty dependency array for one-time initialization

### 4. FogOverlay.tsx
- Added debouncing to geometry optimization (200ms delay)
- Added `isMounted` checks to all async operations
- Fixed dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Reduced status check frequency from 1s to 2s
- Added proper cleanup to all useEffect hooks

### 5. fogLocationIntegrationService.ts
- Added location similarity check before dispatching Redux updates
- Improved location similarity algorithm to include accuracy changes
- Prevented circular updates between location and fog state

## Technical Details

### Debouncing Implementation
```typescript
// Camera updates debounced to prevent excessive re-renders
useEffect(() => {
  if (isMapReady && cameraRef.current) {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      if (cameraRef.current) {
        cameraRef.current.setCamera({...});
      }
    }, 100);
    
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
}, [viewport.center, viewport.zoom, viewport.bearing, viewport.pitch, isMapReady]);
```

### isMounted Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  
  const asyncOperation = async () => {
    if (!isMounted) return;
    // Safe to update state
  };
  
  return () => {
    isMounted = false;
  };
}, []);
```

### Location Similarity Check
```typescript
private isLocationSimilar(loc1: LocationUpdate, loc2: LocationUpdate): boolean {
  const distance = this.calculateDistance(
    loc1.latitude, loc1.longitude,
    loc2.latitude, loc2.longitude
  );
  
  const accuracyImprovement = Math.abs(loc1.accuracy - loc2.accuracy);
  return distance < 10 && accuracyImprovement < 5;
}
```

## Testing
- Created verification tests for all fix patterns
- Confirmed debouncing works correctly
- Verified location similarity calculations
- Tested component mounting/unmounting patterns

## Result
The infinite re-render issue should now be resolved on Android. The app will:
- No longer exceed maximum update depth
- Have better performance due to reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Properly clean up resources when components unmount
- Handle location updates more efficiently
